Behold, the source for my resume. It runs on a node.js backend just for kicks.
Remove the js comments in the index and immediately it will harness the power of AngularJS + ui-router.

## Usage
`grunt dev` for dev, watches all the important files that change
`npm start` to run and remove all debug related things

## Deployment
Push to heroku or dokku, it will take care of the rest.
